				<span>wilderness</span>True adventure is done in the wild. On an IGO you will be largely self-suffcient, responsible for your own welfare, and removed from civilisation for the duration.<br>

				<span>camaraderie</span>People are bound by shared experience. Even solo adventures are built upon a crucial team of facilitators. For IGO, teamwork is everything.<br>

				<h3>what we do</h3>
				<h4>Nihillam a endenitatem re volupta tibusandis.</h4>
				<p>IGO was born out of personal, life-changing adventures, the atmosphere is one of challenge, exploration and camaraderie – all set against a backdrop of stunning, natural beauty and remote wildernesses.<br>
				Each carefully chosen location is steeped in adventure history; whether that’s the place Scott trained for his Arctic expedition in Norway, where Thomas Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark to explore the then-unchartered West of America, where the Berbers held the Roman empire at bay in Morocco, or ancient battlefields in Scotland – there is something for everyone.<br>
				Whilst the challenges themselves are physical, the effects are more far-reaching. Arriving in camp after a long day, the feeling of achievement is undeniable. Strangers become friends, united by a common goal and shared experience.<br>
				IGO’s require effort; physical, mental & emotional. But it’s more than simply completing the four days; it’s about being at the threshold of your comfort zone, testing your inner resolve, your determination and drive, and ultimately achieving something extraordinary.</p>
